# VGG Face Annotator
This application lets you mark and tag rectangular facial regions in an image. 
It is a fork of [VGG Image Annotator](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) adapted for face annotation.

## Getting started
 1. You should have received the ```vgg_face.html``` file. (if not, you can view it [here](http://vgg.gitlab.io/via/via_face.html) )
 2. To load new images, click [Image &rarr; Load or Add Images] and select the images that you wish to annotate
 3. Press the key n (or p) to move to next (or previous image)
 4. Click mouse right button and drag to draw a rectangular region around a face in the loaded image
 5. Now, to select this newly created rectangular region, click inside it.
 6. On the left hand side (in section Region Name), click on of the entries to tag this new region.
 7. After selecting a region, you can move or resize it.
 8. Remember to regularly save your work by clicking [Annotation &rarr; Save as CSV].
 9. Next time, to start from where you left, click [Annotation &rarr; Import] and point it to the CSV file saved in Step 8.
 10. You can jump to any image by clicking [Image &rarr; Show Loaded Image List] which shows a list of currently loaded images.
